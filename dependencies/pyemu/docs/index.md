# Introduction

pyEMU is a set of Python modules for model-independent, user-friendly, computer model uncertainty analysis. pyEMU is tightly coupled to the open-source suite PEST (Doherty 2010a and 2010b, and Doherty and other, 2010) and PEST++ (Welter and others, 2015, Welter and other, 2012), which are tools for model-independent parameter estimation.

See the [README](https://github.com/pypest/pyemu?tab=readme-ov-file#what-is-pyemu) for more information, and how to get started.

See the [API Reference](autoapi/pyemu/) for detailed documentation of all pyEMU classes and functions.

See the `.ipynb` example notebooks [on GitHub in the `examples` directory](https://github.com/pypest/pyemu/tree/develop/examples) for hands-on demonstrations of pyEMU functionality.
